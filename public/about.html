    <H1>About Me</H1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Newton Otite, and I’m an aspiring Full Stack Web Developer with a strong passion for technology, creativity, and lifelong learning. I’m currently undergoing a comprehensive Full Stack Web Development course, where I’m building real-world projects that strengthen my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and version control with Git.</p>
    <p>Born on 3rd November 1993, I bring not just technical curiosity but also strong discipline and focus, shaped by my education at Government College Ughelli, where I graduated in 2012.</p>
    <p>What drives me most is the ability to create something meaningful from just an idea turning lines of code into tools, experiences, and solutions that people can actually use. I'm especially interested in clean design, problem-solving, and writing code that not only works but makes sense.</p>
    <p>In addition to coding, I enjoy reading, creating content, and diving into topics that help me grow both professionally and personally.</p>
    <p>I’m excited to continue learning, building, and eventually contributing to teams and projects that make a real impact.</p>
